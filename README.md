1) **The Training Dataset has 60,000 Images each of 784 pixels each associated with a label from 10 classes.**

## Labels:
* 0 : 'T-shirt/top',
* 1 : 'Trouser',
* 2 : 'Pullover',
* 3 : 'Dress',
* 4 : 'Coat',
* 5 : 'Sandal',
* 6 : 'Shirt',
* 7 : 'Sneaker',
* 8 : 'Bag',
* 9 : 'Ankle boot'

2) **The Test Dataset has 10000 Images.**
3) **I have reshaped the Training and the Test Samples into 28 x 28 pixels for further processing.**
4) **I have used Convolutional Neural Networks to Train the Data.**
5) **After every layer, I have used Batch Normalization.**
6) **I have used Dropout layers to avoid Overfitting.**
7) **I have performed Data Augmentation using ImageDataGenerator.**
8) **I have used Learning Rate Decay at every Epoch Stage to reduce learning rate.**
9) **Then, I plot the Confusion Matrix to Evaluate the Performance of the model on the data.**
10) **I have plot some correctly classfied and misclassified Images for Visualization.**
11) **I plot the Classification report and drew important insights.**
12) **Finally, I have predicted on the Test Data and Acheived Accuracy of 93.4%**
